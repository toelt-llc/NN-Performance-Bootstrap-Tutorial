# Code for _Estimating Neural Network's Performance with Bootstrap: a Tutorial_

This repository contains the code that have been used for the paper 

Michelucci, U. and Venturini, F., **Estimating Neural Network's Performance with Bootstrap: a Tutorial**, to be published on the journal [MAKE](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/make) (MDPI).

## How to use this repository

The repository contains a folder, ```code``` that contains one Jupyter Notebook where you will find the code with some examples of the simulations as they are described in the paper. Clicking on the link below
